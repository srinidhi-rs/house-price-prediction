🏡 House Price Prediction Model – Machine Learning Project 🚀

📌 Overview

This House Price Prediction Model uses Linear Regression to estimate property prices based on key factors like average income, area population, and number of rooms. The model is trained on the USA Housing dataset and provides real-time predictions based on user input.

🔍 How It Works

✅ Data Processing: Cleans and prepares housing data using pandas and numpy.

✅ Feature Selection: Focuses on three major factors affecting house prices.

✅ Model Training: Implements LinearRegression from sklearn to learn price patterns.

✅ User Input: Allows users to enter details and get an instant price prediction.

✅ Performance Evaluation: Uses MAE, MSE, and RMSE to measure accuracy.
